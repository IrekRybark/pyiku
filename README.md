# pyiku
Silly little attempt to generate haiku poems based on given corpus of a text.

I call it pyiku to make sure that hypothetical International Association of Haiku Authors does not send mafia after me.

The algorithm is based on gjreda/beer-snob-says attempt to write Twitter bot generating snobby beer reviews.
